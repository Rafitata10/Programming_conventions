# Programming Conventions Problems

Welcome to my new repository! Here, I have uploaded solutions to several programming competition problems from various events. For each problem, you will find a problem description and a C++ solution. Below are the problems I have tackled and the conventions from which they originate.

## Problems Included

1. **Subway Network**
   - **Convention**: Self-styled based on a metro network optimization problem.
   - **Description**: Calculate the minimum number of metro lines required to cover all key points in a city while ensuring that no point is farther than a given distance from a line.
   - **Files**: 
     - `subway network.txt`: Problem description.
     - `subway_network.cc`: C++ solution.

2. **Car Vet** (2018 ECNA Regional Contest - Problem A)
   - **Convention**: 2018 East Central North America (ECNA) Regional Contest.
   - **Description**: In this problem, the task is to manage a car vet service where cars must be organized and serviced efficiently.
   - **Files**:
     - `car vet - 2018 ECNA Regional Contest.txt`: Problem description.
     - `car_vet.cc`: C++ solution.

3. **Job Postings** (2013 UChicago Invitational - Problem G)
   - **Convention**: 2013 UChicago Invitational Problem Set.
   - **Description**: A problem dealing with managing job postings and determining the best way to match candidates with available job positions.
   - **Files**:
     - `job postings - 2013 UChicago Invitational.txt`: Problem description.
     - `job_postings.cc`: C++ solution.

4. **Juice** (ACM ICPC NCPC 2012 - Problem J)
   - **Convention**: ACM ICPC Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC) 2012.
   - **Description**: Solve an optimization problem related to serving juices in the most efficient way possible given certain constraints.
   - **Files**:
     - `juice - ACM ICPC NCPC 2012.txt`: Problem description.
     - `juice.cc`: C++ solution.

## Repository Structure

Each problem in this repository is organized with the following files:
- A `.txt` file containing the problem statement.
- A `.cc` file containing the C++ solution.

Feel free to explore the solutions, and you are welcome to suggest improvements or alternative approaches.
